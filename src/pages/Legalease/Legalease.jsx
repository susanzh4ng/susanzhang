                <h3><i>The building of Legalease</i></h3>
                <br></br>
                <p>In order to accomplish this, I used React.JS in order to create the user interface. I connected the frontend with our backend through API calls written in Node.js. In order to web scrape from <a href='https://www.uscourts.gov/glossary' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US Courts' Glossary of Legal Terms</a>, I used the Cheerio package. Lastly, I implemented Webpack for hot reload and ease of development.</p>

                <h3><i>‚Ä¶ and the roadblocks I ran into</i></h3>
                <br></br>
                <p>Because the webscrapping was set up so that the HTTP post request would send the user‚Äôs term as a string that was concatenated to the end of a US Courts' Glossary of Legal Terms's url, the chrome extension was unusable after one term was defined - since any additional terms were further concatenated to the url. To remedy this, after each subsequent post request, I reset the url to a base url so that it could be sustained.</p>
                <p>Likewise, a similar issue occurred with legal terms that consisted of multiple words, since the US Courts' Glossary of Legal Terms‚Äôs url would not have included spaces. To resolve this, I used JavaScript to find and convert each ‚Äú ‚Äù to a ‚Äú-‚Äù, following the url standards.</p>

                <h3><i>What's next for Legalease</i></h3>
                <br></br>
                <p>The next step is implementing a Saved Terms tab so that the user can go back and review legal terms and view Legalease as a learning experience. Likewise, I also wish to set up user authorization and authentication so that the terms would be saved to a database and can then be revisited.</p>
