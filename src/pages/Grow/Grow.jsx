                <p>Company layoffs, increasing concerns over the job market, and the fluctuating value of a college degree all point to one thing: a career - especially career discovery - is scary. Tasked with a semester-long Interaction Design class project and fueled by the horror stories of being a computer science major amidst the era of tech layoffs, Grow with Google was born!</p>
                <p>Grow is a fictional Google product that allows users to discover and find resources for new career paths. Users can discover employer events, partake in AR & VR discovery activities, and earn highly-sought after credentials! Grow is an addendum to <a href='https://grow.google/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's current effort to nurture careers</a> and aims to provide equal career opportunities while taking advantage of the increasingly technological world.</p>

                <h3><i>The story behind Grow</i></h3>
                <p>I decided to tackle career discovery due to my and my peers' struggles in job-searching. In recent years, post-COVID layoff spillover and market re-correction has aggravated the job search process. An unintended consequence is job seekers pursuing new and pivoting from current career paths.</p>
                <img
                    src={loremipsum}
                    alt="Two women in a job interview"
                    className='designPersona'

                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <h3><i>Professionally stranded</i></h3>
                <p>My target Segment of Interest is young adults who are currently enrolled in or completed an undergraduate degree program. They have little to no professional experience, especially in their preferred career. Their goal is to explore and seek out new career opportunities.</p>
                <p>From literature reviews and user interviews, I found that a major contributor to career pivoting is unawareness of better options, whether that is as a college undergraduate or a veteran in one's career; they stuck with what was familiar and supposedly safe career paths and did not pinpoint their discontent until it appeared to be too late. Another notable contributor disclosed from user interviews and netnography is the user's own lacking â€” whether it is of motivation or physical access to career opportunities. This lack is a more prominent concern that should be addressed as it roots itself in society's own socioeconomic inequalities.</p>
                <p>As such, the chief issues that my segment of interest faces are</p>
                <div className='callout-card Grow-callout'>
                    <h4>Unfamiliarity towards career insights</h4>
                    <p>Whether it is unfamiliarity towards physical job opportunities themselves, or application insights and preferences, the main source of regret I see from my target users is their own unawareness of the opportunities already out there.</p>
                </div>
                <div className='callout-card Grow-callout'>
                    <h4>Lacking purposeful human interaction</h4>
                    <p>Especially post-COVID-19, the job application process is more and more automated and impersonal, directly prompting my target users to prioritize genuine human interactions: company recruiters, employees willing to give referrals, and building one's network.</p>
                </div>
                <div className='callout-card Grow-callout'>
                    <h4>Diffidence in career</h4>
                    <p>Especially as a result of unfamiliarity towards career insights, many of my user interviewees expressed feeling imposter syndrome or otherwise low self-esteem towards their competency in their preferred career path. This is coupled with repeated employment opportunity rejections as a result of a flooded job market.</p>

                <h3><i>What do others think of Grow?</i></h3>
                <p>After creating my first draft of high-fidelity wireframes and its prototype, I began testing my product. After 2 rounds of moderated usability testing followed by a group usability test, I iterated my designs, starting with the â€¦</p>

                    <h4>Home Screen</h4>
                    <p>The Home Screen is the face of Grow. It greatly influenced Grow's visual design and enforced Grow's MVPs. Users could directly access their History from the Home Screen, and, likewise, users can view their Starred Items through the Header Bar. Obscure terminology was rewritten, and the redundant School Resources Card was omitted altogether.</p>

                    <h4>Category Filter</h4>
                    <p>Filtering through items is increasingly popular, especially for a discovery app as the user would not know their item by name. As such, it was a priority to make such a functionality more intuitive. Users can also filter utilizing History and Starred tags, as suggested by both usability testers.</p>

                    <h4>Starred Screen</h4>
                    <p>I intended for the original Starred Screen to be content-driven and match the style of the Search Screen. However, I soon discovered that it appeared too convoluted and inappropriate; content-driven layout is suitable for discovery, but a more detailed view is preferred for finding important items to return to. I also incorporated search and filter functionality for straightforwardness.</p>

This project was my first chance at conducting a group usability test, where multiple users were able to bounce ideas off of eachother and provide me with multiple perspectives at once. It was an enriching experience, and I would love to conduct more for my future projects!</p>

Much research was required to ensure that the app resembled a Google product; no UI decision was made without referencing either Material Design or a Google product. Research on Google's current technology was also essential as many of my initial ideas failed because I didn't do enough reviewing; I had to omit Google Cardboard integration because it was discontinued back in 2021!</p>
