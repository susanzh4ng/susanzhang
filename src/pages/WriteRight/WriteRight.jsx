                <h3><i>The building of WriteRight</i></h3>
                <br></br>
                <p>In order to accomplish this, we used React.JS in order to create the user interface. We were able to connect the frontend with our database through API calls written in Node.js. Likewise, we used MongoDB to store all of our user information and save user‚Äôs worksheets and projects. For the Grammar Checker tab, we used GrammarBot‚Äôs API. Lastly, we used Zustand for state management.</p>

                <h3><i>‚Ä¶ and the roadblocks we ran into</i></h3>
                <br></br>
                <p>Because the user interface was initially developed by me and our fullstack developer independently, we ran into consistency issues in both our design - CSS classes - and object setup - JavaScript API calls. Thankfully, we were able to remedy that through reconnaissance; we decided that I was to take the lead on the design and the fullstack developer would take the lead on object setup, which was also made easier through increasing familiarity with Git for version control. </p>
                <p>Additionally, our fullstack developer and backend developer had difficulty integrating the backend and getting the API calls to return the accurate corresponding information. To resolve this, our fullstack developer had to implement Zustand for state management. </p>

                <h3><i>What's next for WriteRight</i></h3>
                <br></br>
                <p>The next step is implementing a Community feature: sharing and interactings with writing. We also want to expand our Sheet template variety to better aid creative writers of all genres ‚Äì not just prose. Lastly, we want to incorporate import and export options, such as from Google Drive, Box, and from your device.</p>
