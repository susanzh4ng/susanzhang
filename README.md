Susan Zhang is a Computer Science and Experience Design student based in Dallas-Fort Worth, TX. Currently, she is a Designer and Corporate Relations Assistant for UTDesign — UT Dallas's engineering and computer science senior capstone program — where she designs print media, graphics, and websites for students and C-suite members alike.

Her story starts with a virtual web development course she took back in high school. Vanilla JavaScript and HTML were enough for her to code a crude website, enough for functionality, but it was CSS that truly enticed her. Web design was the first time she was exposed to the intersection between computer science and art. Now, the principles of design, from having art as a first love, pour out in the form of code. She spaces out elements with Bootstrap components and margins by the pixel, choose color palettes that pass contrast checkers, and orient texts and images through display settings and padding. She does this in an attempt to make a sliver of the Internet her own.
